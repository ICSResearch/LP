# LP
The implementation of Learning-based Padding: From Connectivity on Data Borders to Data Padding.


## Statement
- You can find LPC/LPA module in learning_padding.py

## Environment
- python 3.8
- pytorch 1.7.1 (>=1.2.0)

## Usage
### 1. Employing LP module for you network.
If you want to pad a C channels feature map M with S stride.
```
from learning_padding import LearningPaddingByConvolution, LearningPaddingByAttention


LPC_map = LearningPaddingByConvolution(in_channels=C, stride=S)
LPA_map = LearningPaddingByAttention(in_channels=C, stride=S)
```

### 2. If you want to employ LPC/LPA module for a pretrained network with zero padding.

1. import upgrade.py file.
```
from upgrade import Upgrade
```

2. Prepare your network and load the checkpoint.

3. Upgrade your network. You have to choose the padding type, 'LPC' or 'LPA'.
```
upgrade = Upgrade(net, 'LPA')
new_net = upgrade.new_net
```
